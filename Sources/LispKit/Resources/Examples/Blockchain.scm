;;; Blockchain
;;;
;;; This is an implementation of a very simple blockchain. This code was
;;; inspired by the book "Introducing Blockchain with Lisp" by Boro
;;; Sitnikovski (Apress), which incrementally builds a simple blockchain
;;; in Racket. The example code in this file was written from scratch but
;;; keeps a similar structure like the Racket implementation, so it can be
;;; used together with the book. Nevertheless, the actual code is quite
;;; different and makes idiomatic use of LispKit coding style and libraries.
;;; A similar implementation in Java is described here:
;;; https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/create-simple-blockchain-java-tutorial-from-scratch-6eeed3cb03fa
;;; 
;;; The code below incrementally introduces all abstractions needed for
;;; a simple blockchain starting with wallets, including transaction
;;; inputs/outputs, transactions, blocks, and finally the blockchain data
;;; structure itself. The implementation only allows for one transaction
;;; per block.
;;;
;;; The code provides a comprehensive library of debugging procedures that
;;; are able to print out the various data structures. The code concludes
;;; with an example usage of the abstractions.
