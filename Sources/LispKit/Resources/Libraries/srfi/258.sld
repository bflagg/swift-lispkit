;;; SRFI 258
;;; Uninterned Symbols
;;; 
;;; This SRFI provides functionality to deal with uninterend symbols.
;;; An uninterned symbol is not the same as any other symbol, even one
;;; with the same name. These symbols are useful in macro programming
;;; and in other situations where guaranteed-unique names are needed.
